This is attempt to implement an editor for Diablo 2 Resurrected level tiles in a modern environmnent. It's goal to make editing levels 
as simple as possible.

This is WIP prototype

No commercial use is intended. No content related to Diablo 2 is used in repository.

# How to edit levels

Requirements:
1. Unpack your D2R data using any CASC View tool available(Ladislav 's viewer works fine - http://www.zezula.net/download/cascview_en.zip)
1. Download Unity version 6000.0.32f1. 

You will see new menu item *Diablo level editor* in Unity Editor. Use command Diablo level editor -> Open Level.

# Project status

For now it's just a prototype capable of basic work with JSON/DS1 formats. Updates will come shortly as 
I will implement work with models/vfx and old stuff.
